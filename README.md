# Estimation-of-the-Curve-by-Euler-Method

The Euler Method of approximation is used in this code to estimate and predict the shape of the Curve with the help of two datas- the initial points and the differential equation. 

Input to be given by the user---> [y,x]= Euler(stepsize, initial value of x, initial value of y, x at which y is to be found); where stepsize is the difference between two xs.

Output- The expected curve that is the solution to the Equation. 

In my code, I have set the differential equation as default. You may change it as per your interest. 

Default Differential Equation- dy/dx + 2y= 2-exp(-4x) with initial condition as y(0)=1/
